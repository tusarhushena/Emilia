Some chats get a lot of users joining just to spam. This could be because they're trolls, or part of a spam network.
To slow them down, you could try enabling CAPTCHAs. New users joining your chat will be required to complete a test to confirm that they're real people.'

**Admin commands**:

• /captcha `<yes/no/on/off>`: All users that join will need to solve a CAPTCHA. This proves they aren't a bot!
• /captchamode `<button/math/text>`: Choose which CAPTCHA type to use for your chat.
• /captcharules `<yes/no/on/off>`: Require new users accept the rules before being able to speak in the chat.
• /setcaptchatext `<text>`: Customise the CAPTCHA button.
• /resetcaptchatext: Reset the CAPTCHA button to the default text.
• /recaptcha `<yes/no/on/off>`: {BOT_NAME} will ask the CAPTCHA to every new user, be it someone who has joined before and verified already

**Examples**:

• Enable CAPTCHAs
-> `/captcha on`

• Change the CAPTCHA mode to text.
-> `/captchamode text`

• Enable CAPTCHA rules, forcing users to read the rules before being allowed to speak.
-> `/captcharules on`

**NOTE**:
For CAPTCHAs to be enabled, you MUST have enabled welcome messages. If you disable welcome messages, CAPTCHAs will also stop.
